Intro to OMS Documentation
==========================

There is a lot going on in OMS, and you may not know where to start - the
intention with this page is to present to you a breakdown of what documentation
exists where, to serve as a map to these new lands.

You may be interested in one of the following guides:

* :ref:`Get Started with OMS <get_started>`
* :ref:`Tutorials - Build Applications with OMS <tutorials>`
* :ref:`Contribute to OMS Development <contributing>`

If you are looking for API integration docs for OpenID Connect, they can be
found in the section for :ref:`OpenID Connect <oidc>`.

Additionally, the following sections may be of interest:

* :ref:`High-Level Explanation of OMS <overview>`
* :ref:`List of Features <oms_features>`
* :ref:`OMS Release Notes <release_notes>`


API Documentation
-----------------

OMS creates the framework for an ecosystem of modules, and instances of OMS
nodes are living reflections (or different representations) of these ecosystems
- instances and their constituents are each simultaneously parts of the whole.

Each part aims to be a fully capable holon within the holarchies it chooses
(or is elected) to be a part of, and documentation is no different. Each
repository with OMS source code aims to be as self-documented, and complete as
possible. This is a work in progress, especially as new repositories rapidly
come online.

Here is a breakdown of the documentation projects embedded in each OMS source
code repository. It is intended that each repository is capable of accurately
representing themselves within the OMS ecosystems they are a part of.
