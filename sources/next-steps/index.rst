Next Steps with OMS
===================

Now that you've had a chance to explore OMS, understand its architecture, and
set up a TCC, we invite you to browse the source code repositories and build
your own OMS-enabled virtual machine images.

We also welcome contributions to the OMS codebase. Please see the
`OMS Contributor Documentation`_ for more information.
