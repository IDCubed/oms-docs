How much does OMS cost?
..........................

   OMS is 100% free, it is open source, so you can use it without paying.

What open source license are you using?

   We are using the MIT, see it here:

Does OMS run on Mac OS X or Windows?

   Not at this time, OMS currently only runs on Ubuntu Linux, but you
   can use VirtualBox to run OMS in a virtual machine on your box, and
   get the best of both worlds. Check out the
