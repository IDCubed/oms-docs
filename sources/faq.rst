Most frequently asked questions
-------------------------------

How much does OMS cost?
.......................

   OMS is 100% free, it is open source, so you can use it without paying.
   Trust Networks may be deployed to VMs locally or in the cloud, so 
   associated hosting costs would apply.


What open source license are you using?
.......................................

   We are using the MIT, see it here:
   https://github.com/IDCubed/oms-docs/blob/master/LICENSE


Does OMS run on either Mac OS X or Windows?
...........................................

   Yes, but not directly, eg:  OMS currently only runs on Ubuntu Linux, but you
   can use VirtualBox to run OMS in a virtual machine on your box, and get the
   best of both worlds. Check out the :ref:`Importable VM Appliances
   <get_started_importable_appliances>`.


What OS is the OMS TCF built on?
................................

   OMS is built on Ubuntu Linux, specifically the 12.04 LTS release. Automation
   is at the core of OMS and pervasive throughout the framework, so porting OMS
   to new include or be based on new or different services, OS, platforms, etc,
   tends to be a rather straightforward process.


Can I help by adding some questions and answers?
................................................

   Definitely! The documentation has a :ref:`Contributor's Guide
   <contribute_docs>` to help you get started in editing the documentation
   source. This page in particular is ``sources/faq.rst``.
