Most frequently asked questions.
--------------------------------

How much does OMS cost?
..........................

   OMS is 100% free, it is open source, so you can use it without paying.
   Trust Networks may be deployed to VMs locally or in the cloud, so 
   associated hosting costs would apply.


What open source license are you using?
.......................................

   We are using the MIT, see it here:
   https://github.com/IDCubed/oms-docs/blob/master/LICENSE


Does OMS run on either Mac OS X or Windows?
...........................................

   Yes, but not directly, eg:  OMS currently only runs on Ubuntu Linux, but you
   can use VirtualBox to run OMS in a virtual machine on your box, and get the
   best of both worlds. Check out the :ref:`Development VM Setup
   <deploy_development_vm>`.


Can I help by adding some questions and answers?
................................................

   Definitely! Start with the :ref:`Contributing Documentation Guide
   <contribute_docs>` and edit the documentation sources, ``sources/faq.rst`` in
   particular.
