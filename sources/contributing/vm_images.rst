VM Builder's Guide
==================

This guide will step through using `packer.io`_ and the utilities provided by
the oms-kickstart repository to automate building VM images for VirtualBox. The
tutorial will show examples using OMS build process, but the instructions are
generic in nature.

.. _packer.io: http://packer.io


.. note::

   This process has been tested on Debian Linux 7.x and FreeBSD 9.2.


Initial Set Up
--------------

Packer is a very light-weight framework for automating the process of building
containers and images for use in various virtualization technologies. Packer
includes automated structures for a handful of subsystems, from qemu, to AWS,
openstack, and even docker.io. Additionally, Packer has support for different
types of provisioners, including shell scripts and file uploads, Ansible, Puppet,
and SaltStack.

.. note::

   As of the v0.8.5 release, OMS provides the means to build VM images for
   VirtualBox, using packer.io, oms-kickstart, and saltstack.


VirtualBox
~~~~~~~~~~

To build VM images for VirtualBox, we first need both VirtualBox and the packer
command line utility installed and available on a host that can support running
Virtual Machines. It is best to use a physical desktop, laptop, or rackmount
with at least 4GB of RAM and a quad core CPU. It is possible to run a single VM
at a time with less power (2GB/dual-core), but such a setup is not recommended.
Also be sure to confirm that the CPU's Virtualization Extensions are enabled in
the BIOS.

.. todo:: see if we can find instructions on enabling this for intel/amd cpus


:ref:`There are references here <install_virtualbox>` to get started with
installing VirtualBox.


Packer Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing the Packer command line tool is even easier. Packer is `distributed
as a zip archive`_ of prebuilt binaries. `Here are the installation docs`_.

.. _distributed as a zip archive: http://www.packer.io/downloads.html
.. _here are the installation docs: http://www.packer.io/docs/installation.html


Here they are as well:

#. Unzip the archive. Your user's home (``~/packer/``), or a path such as
   ``/usr/local/bin/packer/`` or ``/usr/local/packer/`` are good locations.
#. Update the ``PATH`` shell environment variable to include this directory. This
   detail will depend on the shell you use. If using bash, something like this
   should suffice: ``echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/packer/" >> ~/.bash_aliases``.
   To activate this for the open shell, ``source ~/.bash_aliases``. Note, update
   the path (*$HOME/packer/*) if you have installed packer to another location.
#. Test to confirm with ``packer -v``, you should see something like ``Packer
   v0.5.2``.


oms-kickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   fill in this section with details about what to setup first, for oms-kickstart,
   before getting into anything about templates

Packer is a very light-weight framework for automating the process of building
containers and images for use in various virtualization technologies. Packer
includes automated structures focused on creating and manipulating virtual
systems (VMs, cloud instances, containers, etc). It can, for example, boot up a
new VM, download and provide an ISO to boot and install the host OS, and initiate
an unattended installation, even entering in arbitrary text as if entered by a
human on the terminal.

This provides an interesting distiction, Packer provides the means to automate
the installation of arbitary host OS, but it does not include any pre-defined
templates for building even the most common systems. Thus, oms-kickstart includes
these templates, as well as all the scripts and the configuration needed to build
VM images with Packer, for OMS.

.. note::

   Given the flexibility provided by OMS generic provisioning framework,
   oms-kickstart, this build process could easily build VM images for most
   anything you could deploy with Salt states/formula, on a Ubuntu 12.04 VM.



Let's Build some VM!
--------------------

Here is the short and sweet version to building VM images:

#. Clone oms-kickstart git repo: ``git clone
   https://github.com/IDCubed/oms-kickstart.git``
#. Setup SSH key with github (details below)
#. Build the first base VM image, a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS host, with a fresh install
   and nothing else (details below).
#. Import the Ubuntu base (just built), and build the second base VM image, the
   OMS base. Upload the scripts and configuration needed to ignite the kickstart
   provisioning process, but don't actually run anything (details below).
#. Import the OMS base (just built), and build a new image having initiated the
   kickstart provisioning process (details below).


For the process outlined above, Packer will:

* ensure it has the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD, as well as the ISO it needs
  to install an OS on the VM;
* create a new VirtualBox VM;
* mount and boot the VM with the OS install disk;
* navigate the OS install enough to bootstrap an automated installation, hosting
  a *preseed.cfg* for the debian/ubuntu automated install;
* run through the automated install, creating an initial user in the process
* wrap up the build and package the VM as an importable open appliance *.ova*.
* import the *ubuntu-base.ova* image as a new VM;
* use the initial user to access the VM via SSH, upload some files and scripts
  for the provisioning process;
* export the VM as an importable open appliance, *oms-base.ova*;
* import the *oms-base.ova* image as a new VM, ignite kickstart provisioning;
* export the VM as an importable open appliance, *oms.ova*.


You can then use VirtualBox to import this virtual appliance to create new VM as
needed, :ref:`The import process is detailed here <import_vbox_vm_image>`. This is
a great setup for local development, custom deployments, and general hacking with
OMS!



Create an SSH key to access Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kickstart script, along with steps run by salt later in the provisioning
process, will need to checkout code from the OMS git repos on Github. Some of the
repositories require authentication, and the build process is expected to run as
a completely automated process, so SSH keys are needed by the build system to
successfully create the VM image.

This is the same as when deploying OMS in the cloud, we do this just before running
kickstart. In this case, if we create the files, Packer is setup to provide them
to the VM before kickstarting the OMS deployment to the VM.

Create an ssh key with ``ssh-keygen``, saved to
``oms-kickstart/config/.ssh/id_rsa``, and do not use a passphrase for the key.
A future release of OMS will allow you to do so - at present, a passphrase will
prevent OMSâ€™ automation from working properly.

.. code:: bash

   # assuming the current working directory is /var/oms/src/oms-kickstart/
   oms% pwd
   /var/oms/src/oms-kickstart/
   oms% ssh-keygen
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): config/.ssh/id_rsa
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   Your identification has been saved in config/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in config/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   0d:f2:09:b8:17:51:f9:08:4e:2c:c5:23:bf:3d:48:95 root@oms
   The key's randomart image is:
   +--[ RSA 2048]----+
   | +..o o oo       |
   |  @  =.=E.       |
   | .  .o .2-0      |
   |                 |
   |    . + S .      |
   | o   skj2o       |
   |     .   .       |
   |    . + S .      |
   |                 |
   +-----------------+
   oms% ls -alh packer/uploads/.ssh/
   total 8
   drwxr-xr-x  2 root  root     5B Dec  6 10:54 .
   drwxr-xr-x  4 root  root     4B Dec  3 15:00 ..

   -rw-r--r--  1 root  root   398B Dec  6 10:54 id_rsa.pub


Add the public key to your github account, you can view the key with:
``cat oms-kickstart/config/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. To add the key to your account,
navigate to *Account Settings* in the Github web UI and then *SSH Keys* in the
navigation bar on the lefthand side. Copy/paste the contents of *id_rsa.pub*
into the form on this page.

With the public key in Github, OMS will be able to checkout its source code on
your behalf.


Add an authorized_keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is optional.

If you are building an image for personal use (eg not for public distribution),
or if you intend on making some *post-production* tweaks to the VM before
releasing the image, you can provide the VM with an authorized_keys file:

.. code:: bash

   oms% cat /home/<you>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> uploads/.ssh/authorized_keys


Note that while this is optional, it may provide a simpler flow for what you need
to do with the VM image after it is built. If you do not see the VM with an
authorized_keys file, SSH will prompt for password authentication when you connect
to the VM. The password the user is created with is defined in the configuration
used to automate the OS install (*preseed.cfg*). Customizing the use of this
user should not be necessary and is not recommended.


Build Ubuntu Base VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default build template for the Ubuntu base image will install a new Ubuntu
12.04 LTS host from an official Ubuntu ISO (SHA256 verified). The install is
fully automated, though you should be careful not to interrupt the automated
installation running on the VirtualBox VM. The build will require 15 to 45
minutes to complete - this will vary based on the computing and network
resources you have available.

Here is what the build will look like on the command line:

.. code:: bash

   oms-kickstart/packer$ packer build templates/ubuntu-base.json

   virtualbox-iso output will be in this color.

This VM image can be used by other build templates using Packer's
``virtualbox-ovf`` build module. Should you need a fresh Ubuntu VM for anything,
it could also be imported into VirtualBox to create a new VM.


Build the OMS Base VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This next build is the simplest and shortest - packer will import the Ubuntu
Base just created, upload all the scripts and configuration needed to run the
kickstart process, and then export the VM to create an image. This build is
expected to run for 5 to 10 minutes.

Here is the build from the command line:

.. code:: bash

   /home/oms/zCode/oms-kickstart/packer$ packer build -var oms_version='v0.8.5-rc' templates/oms/base/ubuntu_ovf.json 
   virtualbox-ovf output will be in this color.

This VM image has been setup to run the kickstart provisioning process, but the
process has not actually been run. At this point, the VM image can either be
used as a base for the kickstarted build template, and/or the image can be
imported into VirtualBox to create VMs as needed. This is sometimes a great way
to debug a kickstart build that is failing.


Build (and kickstart) an OMS VM Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, this will build a new VM image, and deploy a fully working
installation of the OMS reference Trusted Compute Framework (TCF) and Trusted
Compute Cell (TCC). This build *runs* the kickstart process, so the time it
takes to build this VM is dependent on the kickstart process you initiate. The
default build will take anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete.


Here is the kickstart build from the command line:

.. code:: bash

   /home/oms/zCode/oms-kickstart/packer$ packer build -var oms_version='v0.8.5-rc' -var kickstart_opts='-H -c config/release.yaml -c config/pillar/release.yaml' -var ovf_path='builds/oms-base/v0.8.5-rc/oms-base.ova' templates/oms/kickstarted.json

You can then import the image as a new VM, in VirtualBox, and start hacking on
OMS directly, demoing and exploring the OMS TCC, OIDC, CoreID Registry, etc.



A few key points about packer
-----------------------------

The details above are meant to get you started, the remainder of the document
will cover, if only briefly, various issues you should be aware of when using
these mechanisms to build VM images in OMS.


About build templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packer uses a simple json manifest to define templates for packer to build
images and containers from. The templates used to build Ubuntu VM for OMS and
kickstart the provisioning process are included in the `oms-kickstart
repository`_. On an OMS Host, these templates could be found in
``/var/oms/src/oms-kickstart/packer``.

.. _oms-kickstart repository: https://github.com/IDCubed/oms-kickstart/tree/master/packer

Unfortunately, the build templates are required to be pure JSON, so you will
not find much in the way of inline documentation/commentary.


About user variables in packer templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The templates included in oms-kickstart make use of various user variables.
These variables make it easier to customize the details of the image built.
Packer enables the user to override these variables in more than one way. If you
do need to customize any of these values, please use what works best for you.
This documentation will provide examples on the command line.

The following user variables are available in *all* templates included in the
oms-kickstart repository:

=============  =============  ==================================================
Variable Name  Default Value  Description
=============  =============  ==================================================
build_name     ubuntu-base    name of the VM image and build directory.
system_user    oms            the username of packer's admin user. packer will
                              SSH to the new VM host as this user.
system_pass    oms            the password for packer's admin user
system_memory  256            the amount of memory (MB) to setup the VM with.
=============  =============  ==================================================

This, by default, the VM image that results has been setup with 256 MB of memory
and a single user (``oms``) has been created for administrative and automation
purposes.

Each build template may define and use user variables in addition to those listed
here. These are detailed in the sections to follow.


About the packer administrative user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To apply any post-install provisioning steps outlined in the template, packer
expects the system/image it is manipulating to have a system user. In the image
building framework included in oms-kickstart, installing the base OS (Ubuntu) is
completely automated within packer and leverages the existing automated
installation framework provided by Debian/Ubuntu. It is within ``preseed.cfg``
that we create the initial administrative user for packer, and set the password
for this user.

While it is not normally necessary to do so, you may customize the automated
Ubuntu install. If you choose to customize the system user available to packer,
note that updating the ``system_user`` user variable will not change the user or
password defined in ``preseed.cfg``, it will only tell packer to use a different
username/password when it attempts to SSH to the new VM.


Provisioners
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the build completes, packer will run one or more provisioners of different
types. The system automation framework included in the oms-kickstart repository
includes the following scripts as provisioners, as part of running the kickstart
image build framework:

* *setup.sh*: Ensure the OMS administrative user has SSH directories and keys in
  place, and proper permissions on all files. Finally, copy the SSH keys to
  root's home.
* *vbox_guest.sh*: mount the guest additions .iso and run their installation
  script.
* *cleanup/*: run some clean up with apt, remove the SSH keys and any stale
  DHCP leases/udev configuration.

These can be found in the ``packer/uploads/kickstart/`` directory within the
oms-kickstart repository.

.. note::

   I need to sort out the discrepency between the oms-kickstart and the kickstart
   directories in oms-kickstart/packer/uploads/


About Each Build template
-------------------------

Packer uses a json files, known as a *template* in packer.io, to tell it what to
do. This is packer's concept of a manifest for the build process. The v0.8.5 release includes five templates of interest in building VM images
with or for OMS. This sections includes high-level details about each template
while the next section 

.. note::

   some details, such as the variables available with each build template, are
   not all listed/included in the documentation below.. but it should be.
   review this until it is correct and complete, then remove this message.


ubuntu-base
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a basic virtualbox VM image with a default Ubuntu 12.04 LTS host system
installed. Nothing more, nothing less.


oms/base/ubuntu-iso
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using packer's ``virtualbox-iso`` builder..

#. download Ubuntu's mini ISO for network-based installs,
#. initiate an automated install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTC,
#. create an OVA-formatted image suitable for importing into VirtualBox.

After packer has installed the host OS (eg, the build is complete), the following
provisioners will run:

#. *setup.sh*,
#. *vbox_guest.sh*,
#. *cleanup.sh*.

Kickstart is setup, but not run.


oms/base/ubuntu-ovf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using packer's ``virtualbox-ovf`` builder, import an existing OVA image as a new
host, upload the kickstart scripts, config, and SSH keys, and run the OMS packer
provisioner scripts (same as above). Kickstart is setup, but not run.

Additional user variables available:

* ``ovf_path``: the full/relative path (on the filesystem) to the OVF image to
  import. This defaults to *builds/ubuntu-base/ubuntu-base.ova*. You may use
  a symlink to improve the development flow.
* ``oms_version``: used to create the vm image filename, defaults to
  *qa-develop*.


oms/kickstarted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using packer's ``virtualbox-ovf`` builder, import an existing OMS base image
and execute the OMS kickstart and peripheral provisioning scripts.


oms/kickstarted-iso
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using packer's ``virtualbox-iso`` builder, create a completely new Ubuntu VM, as
a new install, using a Ubuntu iso. Kickstart is then setup and run after this.


Review and Update the Templates
-------------------------------

Included in
oms-core are two templates. One template builds new Ubuntu VM without running the
OMS kickstart deployment, and a second one that runs the kickstart script to
build a developer's environment based on the OMS master release.

You may wish to update the details of this manifest. The user variables have been
defined at the top for your convenience.
