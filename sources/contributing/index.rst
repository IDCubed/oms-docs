Contributing
============

Start first by reviewing `this document on the OMS Wiki`_ for a walkthrough of
some of our development processes.

.. _this document on the OMS Wiki: https://wiki.idhypercubed.org/wiki/ProjectDocumentation


You can either start from a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and deploy a new
instance of OMS - review the :ref:`Kickstart a VM Guide<initial_deploy>` - or
start with the pre-packaged and self-contained :ref:`TAB Development VM
<tab_developer_vm>`. The latter intends on being an alternative if you would
like to work from a local VM (as opposed to working on a VM in the cloud).
